I'm a passionate, self-taught `GNU/Linux` enthusiast from Hong Kong who started this journey at age 13 and now has over 7 years of experience, currently as a first-year Information Security student. I'm completely in love with `Arch Linux`, running `Hyprland` as my daily DWM, and focusing on three main areas: `GNU/Linux, cybersecurity, and ricing`, with particular interests in ethical hacking and GNU/Linux ricing.

Check out my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/UmmItC/dotfiles.git)! :p

I'm also a top committer of HK :D (Ranking 22~)

## CTF Player

As cybersecurity enthusiasts, I also play CTFs when I can. Currently, I'm a team member of [ICEDTEA (冰茶戰隊)](https://ic3dt3a.org/).

I'm also preparing for my first penetration testing certification - the CPTS (yes, not the OSCP, as it's too expensive for me right now). Hack The Box offers better value for me. and more harder i like it more.

### GNU/Linux

I use Arch as my daily driver, Debian/Raspberry Pi for servers, and am currently trying out NixOS, which seems very maintainable for server use.
