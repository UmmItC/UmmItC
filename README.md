I'm a passionate, self-taught `GNU/Linux` enthusiast from Hong Kong who started this journey at age 13 and now has over 7 years of experience - currently a first-year Information Security student completely in love with `Arch Linux`, running `Hyprland` as my daily driver while focusing on three main areas: `GNU/Linux, cybersecurity, and ricing`, with particular interests in ethical hacking and GNU/Linux ricing.
